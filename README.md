## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running the bots, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** installed (v14 or higher).
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) to install dependencies.
- API keys for each platform (**Alex**, **Velar**, **STX City**), which you can get from the respective platformâ€™s developer portal.
